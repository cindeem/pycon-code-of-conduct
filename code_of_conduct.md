py4science US is a community meeting intended for networking and collaboration in the developer community.

We value the participation of each member of the py4science community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the meeting and at all meeting events, whether officially sponsored by py4science or not.

To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers and volunteers at any py4science event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.

The Short Version
-----------------

py4science is dedicated to providing a harassment-free meeting experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of meeting participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any meeting venue, including talks.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for py4science.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the meeting at the sole discretion of the meeting organizers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

The Longer Version
------------------

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Exhibitors, sponsors or vendors, are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for py4science.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the meeting organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the meeting.

Contact Information
-------------------

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of meeting staff. 


Meeting staff will be happy to help participants contact campus security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the meeting. We value your attendance.
